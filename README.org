* Notebook for NLP Feature Engineering


Based on Alice Zheng's great book on feature engineering, you can find
Alice's repo [[https://github.com/alicezheng/feature-engineering-book][here]].

This is notebook used the yelp challenge dataset to illustrate feature
extraction and engineering for natural language processing (NLP). A
very simple logistic regression model was used to classify the
categories business type, i.e., =['Nightlife', 'Restraunts']=. Methods
used for tokenizing text reviews are:

- bag-of-word (word counting)
- n-gram
- term frequency-inverse document frequency normalization
- L2 normalization
